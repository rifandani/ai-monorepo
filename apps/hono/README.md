## üéØ Todo

- [ ] example of MCP OAUTH
- [ ] example of using langchain
- [ ] integrate LLM observability (e.g phoenix, langfuse, helicone, posthog, sentry)
- [ ] add more evals

## üìù Notes

- when running `bun mcp:stream:example:server` with `--oauth` and found error `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'src' imported from /Users/rizeki.rifandani/Desktop/dev/projects/ai/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/examples/server/demoInMemoryOAuthProvider.js`, you should change the `demoInMemoryOAuthProvider.js` file in the `node_modules` from `import { createOAuthMetadata, mcpAuthRouter } from 'src/server/auth/router.js';` to `import { createOAuthMetadata, mcpAuthRouter } from '../../server/auth/router.js';`. After that it still doesn't work when we try to connect through the inspector.
- check [`@traceloop/node-server-sdk` PR](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-js/pull/606) periodicallly and then continue on from git stash.

## üåé How to MCP

We have a simple example of a MCP server and client in the `./src/mcp` directory.
The `markitdown` folder contains a server in python (cloned from [github](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp), we need to follow their instructions to setup the mcp server) and a client in typescript.
The `stdio` folder contains a simple example of a get pokemon MCP server and client using the `stdio` transport.

1. Using the `markitdown`

First, start the docker service (orbstack or docker desktop), then build the `markitdown` docker image:

```bash
# cd into /apps/hono/src/mcp/markitdown
cd apps/hono/src/mcp/markitdown

# for first timer, build the markitdown docker image
docker build -t markitdown-mcp:latest .
```

Then, run the MCP client script

```bash
# might take a while to get final answer
bun mcp:markitdown:client
```

2. Using the `stdio`

There are two ways to run the MCP server, based on your choice, the `client.ts` also need to be adjusted.

First, by directly running the server as typescript using `tsx` (recommended).

```bash
# directly run the server
bun mcp:stdio:server
```

Second, by compiling it down to javascript and run the javascript file.

```bash
# compile the server to javascript first
bun mcp:stdio:server:js:build

# run the javascript file
bun mcp:stdio:server:js:run
```

After running the server, you can run the client to test it.

```bash
bun mcp:stdio:client
```

3. Using the `Streamable HTTP`

This can be found in the `./src/routes/mcp.ts` file.

```bash
# start the hono dev server
bun dev
```

To run the client directly from HTTP request, you can go to `http://localhost:3333/mcp-client` and test it.

4. Using the `Streamable HTTP` example from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` node_modules

To start the streamable http mcp server.

```bash
# start the streamable http mcp server
bun mcp:stream:example:server
```

And then, start the client.

```bash
# cd into /apps/hono
cd apps/hono

# start the streamable http mcp client using regular node & npm (using bun throws errors `TypeError: process.stdin.setRawMode is not a function`)
npm run mcp:stream:example:client
```

5. Using the MCP inspector

Run the inspector for testing and debugging MCP servers. The inspector is a MCP host and client that allows us to test and debug various MCP servers.

```bash
bun mcp:inspector
```

This will start the inspector server on `http://127.0.0.1:6274/`.

- Testing the `markitdown` example. In "Transport Type" choose `STDIO`, in "command" enter `docker`, in "args" enter `run --rm -i markitdown-mcp:latest`.

- Testing the `stdio` example. In "Transport Type" choose `STDIO`, in "command" enter `npm`, in "args" enter `run mcp:stdio:server`. You can also use "command" `bun`, in "args" enter `run $PWD`.

- Testing the `Streamable HTTP` example. Start the hono dev server first. Then, in "Transport Type" choose `Streamable HTTP`, in "URL" enter `http://localhost:3333/mcp`.

- Testing the `Streamable HTTP` example from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` node_modules. In "Transport Type" choose `Streamable HTTP`, in "URL" enter `http://localhost:3000/mcp` (it's using express). The OAuth Server is running on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Updating `markitdown` in `@workspaces/hono/src/mcp/markitdown`

```bash
# cd into /apps/hono/src/mcp/markitdown
cd apps/hono/src/mcp/markitdown

# re-clone the markitdown mcp repo
bunx degit microsoft/markitdown/packages/markitdown-mcp --force
```

## üß™ How to Evals and Red Teaming with `promptfoo`

We use `promptfoo` to eval and red teaming our LLM usage. To run the evals, you can use the following command:

```bash
# use npm to view better logs in terminal
npm run eval

# or, if you run it from the root
npm run eval -w @workspaces/hono
```

To view the evals results, you can use the following command:

```bash
# use npm to view better logs in terminal
npm run eval:view

# or, if you run it from the root
npm run eval:view -w @workspaces/hono
```
