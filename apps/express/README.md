It also spin up Grafana for visualization.

```bash
# cd into root of the workspace
cd ../..

# run the docker compose file
bun compose:up

Then, start the express server.

```bash
# running in port 8084
bun dev
```

Try to make a request to the express server to trigger the OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8084/rolldice?rolls=10

# try to trigger a 400 error
curl http://localhost:8084/rolldice?rolls=abc
